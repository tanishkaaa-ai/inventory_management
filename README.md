## Walkthrough

We begin at the **login page**, where users can securely sign in as an **Admin** or **Staff** based on their roles. Once logged in, the user is taken to the **dashboard**, which gives a clear overview of inventory status and key metrics.

From here, users can view the **product list**, including details like **name**, **barcode**, **category**, and **stock levels**. The **search functionality** allows quick access to any product by name, category, or barcode.

Admins can **add new products**, **edit details**, or **delete entries**. The system supports **role-based access**, meaning staff have limited permissions compared to admins.

**Low-stock items** are automatically flagged, and depending on preferences, **notifications** can be sent to users via **email alerts**.

Lastly, users can **export data** in **Excel or PDF formats** for reporting or backup purposes.
